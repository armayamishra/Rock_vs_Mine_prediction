# Rock_vs_Mine_prediction

This project predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine using sonar signal data and logistic regression. The dataset is preprocessed, including handling missing values and normalizing features, before being split into training and testing sets. Logistic regression is then applied to build and optimize the classification model, aiming for accurate and reliable predictions.
